ham,an old indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago URL slaughter in the name of god by salman rushdie friday march NUMBER NUMBER page aNUMBER washington post the defining image of the week for me is of a small child s burned and blackened arm its tiny fingers curled into a fist protruding from the remains of a human bonfire in ahmadabad gujarat in india the murder of children is something of an indian specialty the routine daily killings of unwanted girl babies the massacre of innocents in nellie assam in the NUMBERs when village turned against neighboring village the massacre of sikh children in delhi during the horrifying reprisal murders that followed indira gandhi s assassination they bear witness to our particular gift always most dazzlingly in evidence at times of religious unrest for dousing our children in kerosene and setting them alight or cutting their throats or smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length of wood i say our because i write as an indian man born and bred who loves india deeply and knows that what one of us does today any of us is potentially capable of doing tomorrow if i take pride in india s strengths then india s sins must be mine as well do i sound angry good ashamed and disgusted i certainly hope so because as india undergoes its worst bout of hindu muslim bloodletting in more than a decade many people have not been sounding anything like angry ashamed or disgusted enough police chiefs have been excusing their men s unwillingness to defend the citizens of india without regard to religion by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to the same sentiments as the nation in general meanwhile india s political masters have been tut tutting and offering the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control it has escaped nobody s notice that the ruling party the bharatiya janata party bjp or indian people s party and the hindu extremists of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council are sister organizations and offshoots of the same parent body even some international commentators such as britain s independent newspaper urge us to beware excess pessimism the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that we re used to it it happens every so often then it dies down that s how life is folks most of the time india is the world s largest secular democracy and if once in a while it lets off a little crazy religious steam we mustn t let that distort the picture of course there are political explanations ever since december NUMBER when a vhp mob demolished a NUMBER year old muslim mosque in ayodhya which they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram hindu fanatics have been looking for this fight the pity of it is that some muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the train load of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic echoes of the killings of hindus and muslims by the train load during the partition riots of NUMBER played right into the hindu extremists hands the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and insufficient radicalism of india s bjp government prime minister atal bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjp s more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together but it isn t working anymore in state elections across the country the bjp is being trounced this may have been the last straw for the vhp firebrands why put up with the government s betrayal of their fascistic agenda when that betrayal doesn t even result in electoral success the electoral failure of the bjp is thus in all probability the spark that lit the fire the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the site of the demolished ayodhya mosque that s where the godhra dead were coming from and there are reprehensibly idiotically tragically muslims in india equally determined to resist them vajpayee has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and wrongs of the ayodhya issue the vhp is no longer prepared to wait the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi in a letter to india s president k r narayanan blames the gujarat government led by a bjp hard liner as well as the central government for doing too little too late she pins the blame firmly on the motivated well planned out and provocative actions of the hindu nationalists but another writer the nobel laureate v s naipaul speaking in india just a week before the violence erupted denounced india s muslims en masse and praised the nationalist movement the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced and mahasveta devi in her letter demands stern legal action against them but the vhp is determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such public pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting them naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces the nobel award the political discourse matters and explains a good deal but there s something beneath it something we don t want to look in the face namely that in india as elsewhere in our darkening world religion is the poison in the blood where religion intervenes mere innocence is no excuse yet we go on skating around this issue speaking of religion in the fashionable language of respect what is there to respect in any of this or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion s dreaded name how well with what fatal results religion erects totems and how willing we are to kill for them and when we ve done it often enough the deadening of affect that results makes it easier to do it again so india

these bits but expropriation may be fairer for ip than real p rohit khare URL vast detail on towers collapse may be sealed september NUMBER NUMBER by james glanz and eric lipton what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation s most respected engineering minds it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses an immense body of documentary evidence like maps of the debris piles rare photos and videos has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved may remain buried in sealed files or even destroyed bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation and as it now stands the judge in the case who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being has approved standard legal arrangements that should the lawsuit be settled before trial could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld we re obviously in favor of releasing the information but we can t until we re told what to do said matthys levy an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates who is a consultant in the case and the author of why buildings fall down how structures fail norton NUMBERnd edition NUMBER let s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process of the collapse mr levy said monica gabrielle who lost her husband richard when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign said the information should be disclosed if they have answers and are not going to share them i would be devastated mrs gabrielle said they have a moral obligation the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a silverstein whose companies own a lease on the trade center property and a consortium of insurance companies mr silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack entitling him to some NUMBER billion rather than half that amount as the insurance companies say as both sides have prepared their arguments they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers dean davison a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford one of the insurance companies in the suit said of the findings there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today he conceded that differing opinions among the more than NUMBER insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material as for his own company whose consultants alone have produced more than NUMBER NUMBER pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs mr davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to public authorities and investigative teams still some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources like the port authority of new york and new jersey which built and owned the trade center and supports mr silverstein in the suit mr davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company s ability to release information in a statement the port authority said access to documents would be decided on a case by case basis consistent with applicable law and policy adding that it would cooperate with federal investigations the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings collapse that investigation led by the federal emergency management agency was plagued by few resources a lack of access to crucial information like building plans and infighting among experts and officials a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology or nist an agency that has studied many building disasters officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit gerald mckelvey a spokesman for mr silverstein said of the real estate executive s own heavily financed investigative work we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr silverstein on the material but said no transfer had taken place with no shortage of money or expertise investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well the work should be available to other investigators said ramon gilsanz a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek who was a member of the earlier inquiry it could be used to build better buildings in the future legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information in some cases litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves or they may ask to have them sealed forever it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another some legitimate some not said lee levine a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan koch in washington mr levine said that because of the presumed value of the information the court might look favorably on requests to make it public but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center it s important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny said dr john osteraas director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park calif and a consultant on the case because then the general engineering community can sort it out the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure mr levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates hired by silverstein properties have called upon powerful computer programs originally developed with the pentagon for classified research to create a model of the sept NUMBER attack from beginning to end the result is a compilation of three dimensional images of the severed exterior columns smashed floor and damaged

no such constraints hampered engineers at lza thornton tomasetti brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept NUMBER daniel a cuoco the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell though the fema

discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers mr osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence for months

the forbes NUMBER is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the forbes NUMBER as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did

and of course chicago taught them all how right practically nobody who goes to a top NUMBER american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last NUMBER years or so and their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes NUMBER would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor theory

sites around the world indicated a NUMBER year climate trend of NUMBER NUMBER c per decade which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time christy said global coverage one advantage of the msu dataset is its global coverage microwave sounding units aboard noaa satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than NUMBER percent of the globe each satellite measures the temperature above most points on earth every NUMBER hours the global temperature that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method it neglects vast oceanic and continental regions including antarctica the brazilian rain forests the sahara desert and greenland the most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground based thermometers more than NUMBER NUMBER thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists most of these thermometers which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground are in areas easily accessible to people in the u s and other industrial countries these thermometers are most often found at airports the ground based network is extensive in north america europe russia china and japan it is less comprehensive in africa south america australia and across much of southern asia temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time while balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world they are concentrated in industrial nations there are more than NUMBER NUMBER radiosonde launch sites globally if they were evenly distributed around the world that would equal approximately one for every NUMBER NUMBER square miles of the earth s surface water temperatures which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures come from thermometers on piers and buoys and aboard ships of opportunity the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines the water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage tending instead to be concentrated in heavily travelled shipping lanes and in harbors in the past NUMBER years a new system of approximately NUMBER deep ocean buoys has been established gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data instrument accuracy msu with nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years a method was devised to merge all the data into a single consistent time series each satellite has its own bias that if not calculated and removed would introduce spurious trends the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years and were sufficient to determine these biases because the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations the biases between the satellites are known to within NUMBER NUMBER deg the final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base NUMBER to check the final product comparisons were made over a NUMBER year period with balloon measurements as stated above and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate instrument accuracy ground based thermometers of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings since most thermometers for which long term records exist are in towns and cities the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads parking lots runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization this temperature change may be an artifact of a local asphalt effect rather than a long term widespread climate change instrument accuracy ships of opportunity while the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature this data reflects water temperatures from about three to NUMBER feet below the surface the level from which water is drawn into the ships the thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or

ham, guido i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER there s a brief discussion of this before the definition of max_discriminators all clues with prob min_spamprob and max_spamprob are saved in min and max lists and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too but no more than max_discriminators of them in no case do more than max_discriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with many NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear max_discriminators NUMBER NUMBER times first determined the final outcome that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams turned up a low probability very long spam with a list of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues and NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues yikes i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one NUMBER NUMBER clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get NUMBER NUMBER btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in URL from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at URL and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through URL i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of NUMBER spams and NUMBER hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using NUMBER of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if NUMBER n NUMBER if w NUMBER s w w NUMBER yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n NUMBER lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w xNUMBER xff this at least doubled the process size over what s done now it helped the f n rate significantly but probably hurt the f p rate the f p rate is too low with only NUMBER hams

ham, URL the disappearing alliance by dale franks NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER for over two generations the countries of western europe have been our closest allies we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism tragically a generation from now we may be bitter adversaries europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed progressive transnationalism the key doctrines of this form of post communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas among these are the deconstruction of nationalism the promotion of post nationalist ideas of citizenship i e a global citizenry a redefinition of democracy and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations the european union itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations is post democratic while there is a european parliament the eu s power resides mainly in the unelected european commission ec and its unelected president who face few limits to their power instead of a limited consensual form of government where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws the eu has an appointed oligarchic executive along with a large attendant bureaucracy whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense moreover the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu s political elite both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments this is a step backward in europe s political development european criticism of america is on the rise and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation they hate the fact that our citizens own guns they despise the fact that we execute murderers they resent the fact that our economy is so large and that americans consume so much they also resent and fear the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world on august NUMBER NUMBER adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk s independent newspaper in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained perhaps by a european military invasion followed by a decade or so of occupation fortunately the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic at least for now despite the tongue in cheek nature of this editorial however the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states because they have built such a system in europe they feel it s valid for the rest of the world america however is the biggest obstacle to such a system the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited consensual and constitutional government than it does on compliance with international norms they view all departures from such norms as aberrant because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms they assume that since the process is ostensibly legitimate the results must be as well the trouble with this idea of course is that it gives the views of non democratic authoritarian states the same weight as those of free democratic societies it sanctifies the process with no regard to the actual results thus they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power our repeated references to the us constitution and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms are incomprehensible to them they assume therefore that our refusal is based on arrogance rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights none of this bodes well for the future of euro american friendship or cooperation if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism their criticism of the us will rise while their tolerance of our differences will fall obviously in such a political atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase that thought is frightening enough even more frightening however is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism r a hettinga mailto rah ibuc com the internet bearer

instructions parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for URL time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at URL fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number

times september NUMBER NUMBER monday home edition section main news main news part NUMBER page NUMBER national desk length NUMBER words byline dana calvo times staff writer dateline seattle body the idea came at the end of a long frustrating brown bag session at a public policy think tank here the challenge was to save the city s child care programs staring into his empty coffee cup the meeting coordinator s mind landed on an unlikely solution put a tax just a benign dime a shot on espresso that led to a petition signed by more than NUMBER NUMBER seattle residents and next year voters will decide whether the tax becomes law one that taps right into seattle s legendary addiction to coffee this is after all the town where starbucks was born and where the NUMBER pound of beans became a staple there is one starbucks for every NUMBER NUMBER residents in seattle compared to one per NUMBER NUMBER in new york seattle also has two other major coffee chains tully s coffee and seattle s best coffee as well as countless cafes and espresso carts a recent poll showed that NUMBER of seattle residents would vote for the tax for people outside of seattle who don t understand the consumption of espresso the tax proposal can be seen as crazy said john burbank the think tank s executive director but it was common sense research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol burbank estimates the tax could generate NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year city council aides dispute his figures saying their research shows the tax would bring in NUMBER NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year burbank s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions the think tank s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low income people and it has long championed child care issues burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child care programs made earlier this year by gov gary locke he also says it would provide more low income families with subsidies for child care improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries at bauhaus books coffee the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half day activity not

isn t the issue they just resent being singled out david marsh NUMBER a costume manager drinks up to three espressos a day which means he d be shelling out an extra NUMBER NUMBER a year i for one don t have kids but i drink espresso he said as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain mail tunic i don t mind paying but i think everyone should pay coffeehouses are steamed about it and they ve organized as jolt joined to oppose the latte tax among the members are seattle s chamber of commerce and the city s two largest coffee franchises starbucks and tully s the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes especially during the frantic morning rush if espresso counts come under suspicion coffeehouse owners could face a city audit university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn t add up the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable and this is neither he said on the efficiency side it s surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax for example starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee instead of coffee run though an espresso maker and that consequently they are exempt from the tax would they be right i don t know but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care of course from a public relations perspective this is an ingenious idea and i mean that in a cynical way they ve pitted espresso drinkers against child care supporters and who s going to side with the espresso drinkers in fact the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two step where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness in a liberal city like seattle corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism and throughout the debate over the initiative jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care starbucks will continue to support early learning and childhood development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually the company said however starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages or any other single consumer product the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year the initiative s authors say it is directed at vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso including decaf drip coffee would be exempt burbank says the tax would reach only a pre selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so he s been pitching it as a modern day robin hood tax where the needy get a dime

i could but i don t use the desktop at all never have on any system and i don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because i personally find them awkward ymmv if you must use windows the first step towards a productive system is managing your start menu i use the main level of the start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs NUMBER control panel NUMBER NUMBER mozilla NUMBER NUMBER emacs NUMBER NUMBER dos home NUMBER dos work NUMBER dos incoming each of which gives me a command line but in different directories NUMBER python NUMBER NUMBER ie also explorer home explorer work explorer incoming which open explorer windows in various useful directories the same directories as the dos shortcuts only with the shift key held down and yes i intentionally set it up so that went to my work folder less used programs are taken out of their useless submenus as installed and moved directly into the programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed ad aware NUMBER excel NUMBER im netscape NUMBER NUMBER paint shop pro query tool odbc NUMBER vmware NUMBER word NUMBER all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu yes delete accessories do you honestly ever use it if so it s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem things which never need to be run manually like winzip and quicktime are removed from the programs menu maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle but well worth it on most modern keyboards there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu NUMBER gives me a new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape NUMBER for compatibility testing in my day job ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always open but i quit lesser used applications as soon as i m done using them mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory i install cygwin NUMBER so that the command line is actually useful cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities including mv cp scp ssh man tar less grep patch ncftp cvs and many others and bash which i don t use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to NUMBER x NUMBER almost full screen at NUMBER x NUMBER and screen buffer size to NUMBER x NUMBER set window position at NUMBER x NUMBER and don t let the system position the window in mozilla i set my home page to about blank set internet search to search with google use tabbed browsing open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases always show the tab bar and load links in the background essential for weblog surfing you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background under scripts plugins i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows i turn off the sidebar turn on the site navigation bar delete all pre installed bookmarks and create two bookmarks one which takes me to my webmail and another which takes me to my internal site search NUMBER from which i can find all other bookmarks i need in internet explorer i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog since that s the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within mozilla since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible i use emacs locally and vi remotely because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable for instance editing a cgi script named foo cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo cgi backup file which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this sometime on your favorite web site among other things my emacs file which is actually called _emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory d backup to treat all xml files as docbook all cgi scripts as python and all sql scripts as pl sql to use cygwin s bash shell for m x shell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for yes no questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press m w i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad exe to get all text files to open in emacs i got this idea from ultraedit NUMBER my _emacs file is my second most backed up possession i don t use windows useless directory structure for user home directories on my d drive i have d home contains directories for my books and other personal projects each under cvs control NUMBER also set as my home directory using the home environment variable d work contains directories for each work project also under cvs d incoming set as default download directory for all programs that download things and d backup used by emacs and for temporary storage for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created cvs projects i don t know or care what s where on my c drive i have tried many many address books and still store all my contacts email addresses snail mail addresses phone numbers and other vital personal information in a text file called phone stored in d home phone it is not in any particular format other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries i categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name and use m x occur in emacs

ham,good idea this could also be a job for pNUMBERp lots of people would love to devote their spare cycles bandwidth and unblocked ip addresses to giving the chinese unfettered net access in a sense this is what the peek a booty project does URL but let s play out the next few moves good guys google enables ssl access bad guys chinese government again blocks all access to google domains good guys set up google proxies on ever changing set of hosts peek a booty bad guys ban ssl or any unlicensed opaque traffic at the national firewall good guys hide google traffic inside other innocuous looking activity bad guys require nationwide installation of client side netnannyish software good guys offer software which disables spoofs monitoring software bad guys imprison and harvest organs from people found using monitoring disabling software and on and on the best we can hope is that technological cleverness by raising the costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression brings social liberalization sooner rather than later gordon original message from rohit khare khare alumni caltech edu to fork spamassassin taint org sent monday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject how about subsidizing ssl access to google a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows along with the article i was commenting on rohit in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week the search goes on sept NUMBERth the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google s service is not its card catalog which merely points surfers in the right direction but the entire library by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web if you can get to google s cache you can read anything you d like the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules however all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google or indeed almost all public websites is unencrypted almost all web browsers however include support for secure sockets layer ssl encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a man in the middle to meddle censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china the only choice left is to either ban the entire site range of ip addresses but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article of course the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information why shouldn t the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google or for that matter the rest of the web to date public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the voice of america radio sawa and the like just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project on second thought i can hardly imagine this administration promoting the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights never mind best rohit khare the search goes on china backtracks on banning google up to a point sep NUMBERth NUMBER beijing from the economist print edition in chinese the nickname for google an american internet search engine is gougou meaning doggy for the country s fast growing population of internet users NUMBERm according to an official estimate it is proving an elusive creature earlier this month the chinese authorities blocked access to google from internet service providers in china apparently because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to forbidden sites now after an outcry from those users access has been restored an unusual climbdown by china s zealous internet censors hardly more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet these once provided a handy way for chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites after the blocking of google on august NUMBERst many chinese internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site to far less powerful search engines in china duncan clark the head of a beijing based technology consultancy firm bda china ltd says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the internet until recently it had focused on blocking individual sites including all pages stored on them now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content for example earlier this week when using eastnet a beijing based internet provider a search on google for falun gong a quasi buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually aborted before all the results had time to appear such a search also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes

military hq in palm beach florida owen will canada s isps become spies by declan mccullagh mailto declan mccullagh cnet com staff writer cnet URL august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm pt URL URL washington the canadian government is considering a proposal that would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft URL released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government including the department of justice URL and industry canada URL wrote the NUMBER page blueprint as a near final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early NUMBER arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run of the mill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals canada will be following its obligations under the council of europe s cybercrime treaty URL which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of europe and representatives from both countries police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty URL which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly NUMBER participating nations only albania has formally adopted URL or ratified the treaty michael geist URL a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in e commerce law says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification they ve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes geist said to me that s not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority make that case geist added that there s nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i don t know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data retention orders the united states has a similar requirement called the communications assistance for law enforcement act URL but it applies only to pre internet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews an analyst at the electronic privacy information center URL epic who specializes in international law says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes URL the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information the draft says gus hosein a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if you re allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you re allowed to connect to the internet anonymously hosein said a representative for george radwanski URL canada s privacy commissioner said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does

ham,this article from URL has been sent to you by khare URL sure does explain fork not yet abandoned rohit khare URL some friends indeed do more harm than good september NUMBER NUMBER by mary duenwald friends are supposed to be good for you in recent years scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless they are even less susceptible to the common cold studies show but not all friends have such a salutary effect some lie insult and betray some are overly needy some give too much advice psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends friendship is often very painful said dr harriet lerner a psychologist and the author of the dance of connection in a close enduring friendship jealousy envy anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and i m disbanding it another book when friendship hurts by dr jan yager a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside there s this myth that friendships should last a lifetime dr yager said but sometimes it s better that they end that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all marriage and family relationships between siblings or parents and children have been seen as more important of course troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad as a popular author of relationship advice books dr lerner said never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me dr beverley fehr a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg noted that sociological changes like a NUMBER percent divorce rate have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health now that a marital relationship can t be counted on for stability the way it was in the past and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy said dr fehr the author of friendship processes until the past couple of years the research on friendship focused on its health benefits now we re starting to look at it as a more full relationship said dr suzanna rose a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami like marriage friendship also has negative characteristics the research is in its infancy psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship dr fehr said so far they have only through surveys and interviews figured out that it is a significant problem the early research dr fehr added is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought how can a friend be bad most obviously dr rose said by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill advised pursuit when you think of people who were friends at enron she added you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior betrayal also makes for a bad friendship when friends split up said dr keith e davis a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential another form of betrayal dr yager said is when a friend suddenly turns cold without ever explaining why it s more than just pulling away she said the silent treatment is actually malicious at least as devastating is an affair with the friend s romantic partner as recently happened to one of dr lerner s patients i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out dr lerner said a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person dr yager said one of the NUMBER people who responded to dr yager s most recent survey on friendship described how when she was NUMBER her best friend called her a derogatory name the woman now NUMBER was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since dr yager said emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse but it is more insidious dr yager said some people constantly set up their friends she explained they ll have a party not invite the friend but make sure he or she finds out risk takers betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends dr yager said but they are not the only ones she identifies NUMBER different varieties occupying the second tier of badness are the liar the person who is overly dependent the friend who never listens the person who meddles too much in a friend s life the competitor and the loner who prefers not to spend time with friends most common is the promise breaker this includes everyone from the person who says let s have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them but then isn t dr yager said some friendships go bad as some romantic relationships do when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one with couples it can take NUMBER to NUMBER months for someone to discover there s something important they don t like about the other person said dr rose of florida international one might find for example that in subtle ways the other person is a racist in friendships which are less intense it may take even more time for one person to meet the other s dislike criteria whether a friendship is worth saving dr lerner said depends on how large the injury is sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go she added it s also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person s limitations acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses dr lerner said because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress the healthy response is to pull away dr yager said to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life and start being too busy to get together ever it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship but only one to end it dr yager said friendship because it is voluntary and unregulated is far easier to dissolve than marriage but it is also comparatively fragile experts say ideally the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones dr lerner said it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you re healthy and your life and work are going well she said because when a crisis hits when someone you love dies or you lose your job and your health insurance when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability you will discover how crucial and life preserving good friendship is URL how to advertise for information

home lisa pierce has ground beef and roasts frozen vegetables and french fries even a couple of popsicles what she doesn t have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on nov NUMBER the moose that was rightfully hers but instead went to a neighbor the lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the york county sheriff s department to get back what she says she is owed i think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor said pierce i m a woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it the moose is gone i know that now i want to be compensated for the meat whether or not that happens is uncertain her experience though highlights a law some mainers may not be aware of but should get to know during this peak time of deer versus car accidents as the animals in their mating season come out of the woods the law is simple a big game carcass caught by a car be it a moose deer or bear goes to the person who hits it as long as a law enforcement officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident it comes up quite often in maine say officials last year there were NUMBER NUMBER cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and NUMBER accidents involving moose according to mark latti spokesman for the maine warden service in a state of what NUMBER NUMBER million with only NUMBER NUMBER licensed hunters i don t know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a moose said latti you do have the option of keeping it which for some people can be valuable compensation for a damaged car farm grown deer meat can retail for NUMBER to NUMBER per pound in stores and a butchered or dressed moose which can t be bought or sold anywhere in maine can produce hundreds of pounds of food latti said when it comes to moose the law has been abused since its inception in NUMBER every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car that kind of hunting makes no sense to latti hitting a moose even at a slow speed is no laughing matter large adult moose can weigh up to NUMBER NUMBER pounds and can be more than NUMBER feet tall since the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal sometimes they are fatal in NUMBER latti said there were six moose related fatalities after that when the number of moose hunting permits went from NUMBER NUMBER to NUMBER NUMBER there were less maine had three moose related fatalities in NUMBER one in NUMBER and two this year so far said stephen mccausland spokesman for the maine public safety department pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor s son to school in her NUMBER dodge dynasty she said she was going along at about NUMBER mph on a well traveled road when a moose came out of nowhere by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she said pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it so she said she wasn t able to follow up on the animal until later that day when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the NUMBER it took him to carry it away money she didn t think she should spend by the time she contacted the attorney general s office on nov NUMBER to complain about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbor s price had gone up another NUMBER for the cost of butchering NUMBER pounds of meat and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer s fault that she didn t have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but wanting money ouellette said that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials it s the officer s discretion said latti and if the officer feels the person can t immediately remove the animal he s got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal deer or moose becomes secondary the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal can t wait so we ll probably give it to the next person who stops by this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal herself she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other people especially other women do not have the same experience what about

and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and

ham,right mike i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses

communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about NUMBER hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think NUMBER hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it i m searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea i ve heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there

ham, begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER thugs of south boston and the revenge of the bandit princess the geodesic economy robert a hettinga sunday august NUMBER NUMBER boston when you think about it one way the fbi winter hill vs patriarcha angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely and at its most racist the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs and patriarcha s family were of course the mostly italian thugs think scorsese s upcoming gangs of new york only with counter reformatory overtones hoover s south boston social club putsch starting in the mid NUMBER s was particularly audacious in hindsight the u s federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition era capture of the nation s rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was posthumously swapping it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamine or more properly pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger s crack cocaine era reign of boston s drug markets like the identical fbi sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also rans in cities across the us as a whole went up whole orders of magnitude not mere percentage points as stalin said once quantity has a quality all it s own and make no mistake j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage nation wide so yes on paper at least it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another and the result was on paper at least business as usual same stuff different century with apparently decent people like mr salvati URL accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however to be much more macabre about it that hamburger was greasing if you will an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market legislated out of existence on paper if nowhere else by government fiat and the back door but still elitist will to power of h l mencken s famous bluenoses and busybodies it all starts like all true evil does from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldn t do to alcohol teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller manageable demand the bloody result was like nine more heads of the hydra an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition in more markets and for more things as the NUMBERth century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive or harmful or physically distasteful or carcinogenic or now apparently fattening and then prohibited exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly legislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and finally the ultimate in evil the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end increasingly coercive axe handle beatings by our own government of the sacred liberty of the average but now unavoidably law breaking citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago you don t need government if nobody s breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinson s law governments to survive need more people breaking more laws or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probably echo here his father milton s famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market and never the consumer much less the economy as a whole even especially if those sellers are breaking the law as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there absent the apparent grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover s blatant imposition for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermore stalin couldn t have had better useful idiots than hoover did and neither by an absolutely literal extension did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoover s power craven hand for the entire middle of the NUMBERth century and whitey bulger s hand whether they knew it or not until the end of the millennium a time you ll notice which saw the increasingly steady imposition of mob violence and market control from both state and illegal interests way beyond the imaginings of even the most power mad rum running stock kiting movie flopping bureau pumping nazi appeasing irish bostonian little caesar or as for that matter his safely trust funded and now strictly political descendents in terms of actual financial economics think of what happened to mr salvati and the others dead or alive as a transfer price in human lives of the inevitable consequence of macnamara style vietnam era keynesian social cost input output accounting at its most despicable and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover and his co religionists in state economic control in the name of what really was as you ll now agree just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldn t be a surprise really all race wars are at least fought by thugs though they re usually conceived elsewhere and endorsed at the time by all the right people for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes remember mancur olson s observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though given his penchant for women s clothing for other men and what s actually obscene for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess instead bandit queen of course would be a grievous insult to queens and real bandits everywhere cheers rah URL pagewanted print position top the new york times august NUMBER NUMBER hoover s f b i and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston aug NUMBER it was march NUMBER in the early days of j edgar hoover s war against the mafia f b i agents say congressional investigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england s organized crime boss raymond patriarca two gangsters joseph barboza and vincent flemmi wanted mr patriarca s permission to kill a small time hoodlum edward deegan as they were having a problem with him according to an f b i log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this o k the f b i reported and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in NUMBER the real killers who also happened to be informers for the f b i were left alone four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing to do with it one joseph salvati who spent NUMBER years in prison filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f b i for NUMBER million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f b i the justice department and some f b i agents growing out of the tangled corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f b i s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f b i in boston the documents show that officials at f b i headquarters apparently including mr hoover knew as long ago as NUMBER that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself said vincent garo mr salvati s lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed NUMBER to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvati s innocence when he was put on trial gail marcinkiewicz a spokeswoman for the f b i in boston declined to comment citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation one retired agent john j connolly is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f b i informers james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee led by representative dan burton republican of indiana has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau s knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime including who fired the first shot then on june NUMBER NUMBER mr hoover s office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men and from all indications he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless the agent said the informant s potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi s murders the director does not even respond the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia which he had largely ignored in boston f b i agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization the winter hill gang led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the f b i got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulger s gang was able to take over the rackets in boston sell drugs and even commit murder while the f b i looked the other way one reason the f b i may not have used its information about mr patriarca s involvement in the deegan murder congressional investigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence r i headquarters the f b i agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants to disguise the use of the device the investigators say mr salvati a former truck driver now NUMBER had his sentence

dubious international accords this sad realization september NUMBER brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american ankle biting even as europe lives in a make believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september NUMBER america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september NUMBER being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases like nato belongs to a pre NUMBER NUMBER age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting state sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles and as likely to come from friends as enemies worst case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long term hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us and vice versa the saudi royal family whom NUMBER NUMBER american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed the post NUMBER NUMBER domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnam era invective i think rings hollow after september NUMBER and sounds more like mcclellan s shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton s audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly NUMBER years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high rises politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a value neutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september NUMBER and the subsequent terrible year and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead

ham,the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the universe too big to decrypt my point is there will never be a safe key what i would consider is how long does the data need to be protected if you need to protect the data for longer than NUMBER months do not release it to the public if you are trying to stop the general public your customer from coping the data then use what is available on the market if you want to stop the bootleggers do not release the data to the public i have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked the act of unlocking the key gives away it s secret the tougher the lock the more pissed off your customers will be take ms xp for example only the home user is forced to register think of the nightmare if business had to register every copy how many times have we needed to reinstall our laptop os notice the amount of mac s sold after the xp release these where mostly home users that converted to mac os the new audio cd s that have digital copy protection so not play on my computer does this stop me from copying the cd no however it does make me return them and get my money back the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked jef

into thinking they re some sort of monsters violent ones no less anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their way yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general each with their own brand of attitude to be sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward how is that being monstrous is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public s perception of them

being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue realizes he s been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools sends private e mails to them trying to scare them off exposes any

swimming toward the engine room the ship s fucking sinking and i don t want to be following the idiot dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around you re supposed to just shut up and take it after all why would good ol uncle dave want to hurt you it s all about love right to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted and if you dare complain he savages you

rejected of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card what utter fucking nonsense this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit then the rss

ham, i wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota sioux country as well and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents i do get a lot of my information first hand or in some cases second hand from my father the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe not something that was impressed upon them the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals typically an indian corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe in most tribes a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation usually to the tune of NUMBER NUMBERk per person depending on the tribe the dividend money comes from a number of places with the primary sources being the federal gov t and various businesses assets owned by the indian corporation you have to understand a couple things first a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises everyone gets a check for their share no matter what one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often NUMBER NUMBER for tribal members who are more than happy take their dividend and not work the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes unfortunately to support this type of economics when no one works they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk not indians second even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually by benefits and perks we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run and mostly provide sinecures for other indians a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions an example of this is the haida corporation which while having less NUMBER NUMBER tribal shareholders has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the NUMBER NUMBER million range and growing yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled about NUMBERk in this particular case and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use they don t eat their seed corn and have actually managed to grow their stash in contrast a couple islands over there is another tribe of NUMBER NUMBER people that has a net loss of about NUMBER million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets this particular tribe has a modest income in theory but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and many borrow money against future income incidentally in this particular case the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets somewhat annoying the federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies and the cycle continues so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems in a nutshell a thoroughly pathological culture and society few women reach the age of NUMBER without getting pregnant incest rape and gross promiscuity is rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above on one reservation my parents lived the hiv infection rate was NUMBER many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges courts police etc in short many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere because of their legal status there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior there are many things that i could tell you that i ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself there are always good people in these tribes but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times and this is a mobocracy typically btw if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs try living on one of these messed up indian reservations it will give you an interesting perspective on things there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part even if they maintain their tribal identity in both of these cases the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above the indians are often quite wealthy technically and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income the poverty is social and cultural in nature not economic this was my original point on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run it is like a family corporation writ large it seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary the general concept may have some merit in general western society serving to create a facsimile of a biological

ham, i have translated the article in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the google translation at least it s readable now any corrections appreciated stuff in s is my and others additions to the debate my apologies if i ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed the article makes four main points NUMBER absence of critical clauses in this case the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the gpl is governed NUMBER specification in english only that for the end user as opposed to businesses the gpl doesn t apply because it s not written in french NUMBER arbitary licence change the point here is that under french law the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long where to whom dates and times in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that s not my understanding french law allows a gpl type licence _on condition_ that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are not there is nothing to stop the original author taking back his work the lawyers see this correctly imho as a weakness in the gpl NUMBER hidden defects roughly this clause means that the author s is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer so if linux blows up and data is lost then the authors are liable ciaran johnson says that m oft and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are _all_ invalid just that this one affects the gpl also niall o broinn makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software sales even if no money changes hands as governed very much by consumer law in france anyway rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under french law the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract NUMBER roughly there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid whole article freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licences specialised lawyers look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the free licences and in particular the gpl they have published their study in the review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property NUMBER and their conclusion is grim their approach is interesting the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programmes but rather the licence contracts of free programmes absence of critical clauses the authors tell us that first of all the reference to copyright is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another this is why under international contracts it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring french law american c the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence specification in the english language next the authors remind us that at least in france no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law NUMBER however it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects firstly it is written in english and the fsf doesn t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges this sort of contract to be written in french including for businesses since the notion of user applies not only to consumers but also to businesses professionals c contacted by the editors of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that as far as business is concerned the toubon law is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject but whatever about that the problem is still valid for individuals and while waiting for it french law to change french companies have to deal with it since it is the law of the land a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence another problem much more serious is that according to french law the author of a free programme can at any time invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence in effect the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act i e the licence and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees and also with respect to its location i e where such rights may be excersised and duration of any such grants NUMBER this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences briefly this means that in france or elsewhere if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next the problem of the guarantee hidden defects an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered without guarantee you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts and this is correct however whatever is written in a licence contract one cannot free oneself from the guarantee from hidden defects since it is imposed in the civil code this concept is poorly understood by the layman it protects the buyer whoever it may be individual or business since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law against hidden defects deliberate or made in good faith by the seller for example if one buys a pair of socks in a sale and the shop has a notice specifying that sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it several scenarios are possible you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed obvious and you can sing for your money you couldn t check the socks they were packaged for example and in this case despite the notice neither refund nor exchange you may invoke hidden defect and have them changed or obtain a refund it s up to you personally i have already invoked in shops the hidden defect clause and it always worked well shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then according to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in this case not only does he have to reimburse the product but all expenses incurred by the sale metro tickets to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c this idea of hidden defect applies to all products including programmes this was made abundantly clear by the authorities and the courts surrounding yNUMBERk this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme one could speak about a hidden defect since the source code was available he replied actually concerning the guarantee the question of obvious defect will arise this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person but for distribution to the public at large the problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored during this interview we asked ourselves for example about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code in effect the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme if for that i need to link with a proprietary library communication protocol device driver i may consider as null and void this clause of the gpl the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community freedom merits more than these shoddy licences which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort NUMBER une publication de l institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle noNUMBER juillet NUMBER NUMBER une telle clause

ham,blogstart dublin something from the archives daev walsh forwards an article from the irish digest about billy in the bowl this story is also immortalised in an old dublin song which in turn was mentioned in a pogues track billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman where i now live during the NUMBERth century who discovered a new but not entirely legal way to make money blogend linktext billy in the bowl from daev hellshaw URL subject the case of the stoneybatter strangler a story of my new neighbourhood the irish digest july NUMBER the case of the stoneybatter strangler the handsome deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors then one night he made the biggest mistake of his life dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin but there was one who campaigned among the working class this was billy in the bowl the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billy s sole means of transport was a large bowl shaped car with wheels seated in this bowl the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs one in each hand billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary as he had been born without legs nature however had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and what was most important an unusually handsome face this was billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which together with his black curly hair never failed to halt the females the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl however wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk was falling the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street on dublin s north quays when billy heard the woman s footsteps he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane as his unsuspecting victim drew close the beggar moaned and shouted and cried out for help trembling with excitement the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over the woman lay in a dead faint and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his bowl his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition but failed to give a description of her assailant and as billy in the bowl had figured nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter on one occasion billy in the bowl tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her the incident became known as the NUMBER grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts around this period dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected then came the night that finished billy s career of crime two stoudy built female cooks trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help rushing over they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy thinking there was only one woman grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch she proved much too strong for him however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp finger nails meanwhile her companion acted with speed and daring pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl the grangegorman stoneybatter district became once again a quiet attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev _______________________________ rev dave daev walsh daev URL home URL weekly rant URL is it about a

ham,i got to see powell talk in march NUMBER at the beginning of his reign at the fcc he said they were going to take a real hands off approach so it s funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse one thing he did get right is that he wasn t worried that the us was behind europe in the wireless licensing spectrum this is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit his legacy was is supposed to be rethinking the fcc s role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn t want the government forcing business models onto the private sector his full transcript is here NUMBER interestingly enough i got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole ctia NUMBER las vegas keynote series of speakers clay and i hoped a flight out of ontario to las vegas to do demo support for craig barrett NUMBER his message was that there s no difference between wired and wireless internet it s all the same thing instead of scalable networks we should be thinking about scalable content using magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform the best part of the whole trip wasn t hobnobbing at all but really the fact that the venetian had ran out of rooms they decided to put us up in one of their NUMBER NUMBER night high roller rooms they put clay in one and me in another the venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere but these ones were bigger than my whole house NUMBER greg NUMBER URL NUMBER URL rohit khare wrote i can t believe i actually read a laugh out loud funny profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powell s extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbach s werblog entry rohit a trip to f c c world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell it s one of the first articles i ve seen that captures some of powell s real personality and the way he s viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isn t really a fire breathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know that s not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think he s right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasn t the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policy makers should learn from that experience contrary to lemann s speculation the upstart carriers won t be successful in a gore administration because it s too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than world dominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely that s why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but he s wrong in thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past friday october NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am comments NUMBER URL the chairman by nicholas lemann he s the other powell and no one is sure what he s up to new yorker october NUMBER NUMBER last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious american history course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selma to montgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteen forties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and in deed there was some of that but the main difference between my son s text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government s main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what you d find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them it s an insider s game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the press encouraged by the players who speak in jargon can t get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called f c c world for the federal communications commission f c c world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price NUMBER NUMBER a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairman s dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly self deprecating comedy routine by the commission s chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the f c c is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily life telephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now f c c world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the f c c qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of f c c world aol time warner is part of f c c world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of f c c world in the past two years companies belonging to f c c world have lost trillions of dollars in stock market valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the f c c has been circulating widely within f c c world it evokes f c c world s feverish mood the f c c is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of f c c world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all l d markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since NUMBER and suffering about NUMBER market share loss in business lines to clecs it s a lot easier to think about evil c e o s than to decipher that even in good times f c c world pays obsessive attention to the commission s chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f c c world devotes itself to full time chairman watching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by government official standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what he s really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the f c c s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the f c c s incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy he s always saying that he s an avid moderate and yet he has a rage inciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as he s accused of being a right wing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it ain t about singing kum ba yah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittee s chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you don t care about these regulations hollings said you don t care about the law or what congress sets down that s the fundamental that s the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pell mell down the road and seem to not care at all i think you d be a wonderful executive vice president of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one cannot understand powell s maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the f c c was created by congress in NUMBER but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as f c c world grew up into a comfortable well established place the f c c segued into the role of industrial supervision its real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the public s interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an oft told f c c world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the so and so who owned the anti clinton little rock democrat gazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president f c c world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteen eighties the successful breakup of a t t by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of self confidence onto the consciousness of f c c world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one long distance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the mid nineteen nineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national long distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines a t t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the f c c had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federal agency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of NUMBER one of those massive endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which most people outside f c c world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to f c c world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vice president gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base clinton s slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twenty first century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gore s cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success the f c c had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rule making enforcement and litigation the f c c then headed by reed hundt who was gore s classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only long distance companies like a t t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies see lecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand to hand combat the see leck is supposed to have access to the arbock s switching equipment the arbock won t give the seeleck a key to the room where it s kept so the see leck asks the f c c to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the see lecks companies with names like winstar covad and teligent and into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt s former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and a t t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self dealing stock overselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the NUMBER presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the f c c remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the c e o of s b c communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didn t want wood as head of the f c c because he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn t as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgott roth powell did this deftly for example in december of NUMBER he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speech whimsical intellectual and free associative biblical history joseph schumpeter moore s law that began by making fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the NUMBER act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in who ville who feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act s fertile soil but this feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the see lecks are dead or dying nearly all long distance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the long distance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the NUMBER telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radio station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty five per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the f c c should be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the government s money and muscle to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in f c c world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powell s f c c has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the f c c and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in mid september powell finally initiated a formal review of the f c c s limits on media concentration this doesn t mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of f c c world really make sense while giving the impression that he s having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital divide that is economic inequality in access to the internet he said you know i think there is a mercedes divide i d like to have one and i can t afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the f c c until NUMBER when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the city s open air fish market f c c world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the f c c building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairman s suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in NUMBER when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact prophylactically as he likes to say should wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protégé of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government s legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york public school system it testifies to powell s political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bush s nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school it s sort of like a law school study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom he d invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the f c c for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think we ll never know powell said i don t think it s an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we don t seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line there s a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company it s a similar proposition there are scholars who argue indeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that we re accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes he s like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the NUMBER telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i can t fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly i ve always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things it s going to open up i mean i don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dot com excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirty per cent market share fifty per cent market share i want the bells to bleed then we ll know we ve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while they re there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking there s no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like government promised opportunity the problem with that is there s a morning after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for short term gain we paid a price in long term stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldn t have every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway i don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service i don t buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldn t the part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadn t materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybody s always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the story s quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions don t get that good except once every thirty years and it didn t happen so whatever the reason we re looking at a worldcom that s teetering we re looking at a long distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base a t t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the f c c have done anything to make the long distance companies stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my political answer yes there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s e c investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i don t have those kinds of levers i don t know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gestures in august for example five months after disbanding the f c c s accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that there s one of each of those things but let s not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they aren t direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics it s easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybody s controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity i think that s a possibility i don t think it s nearly the possibility that s ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies like here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic the fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out f c c world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulates so he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that he s carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anything at the f c c that would diminish his chances another is that he s waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in f c c world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powell s idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isn t happy about what has become of his telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than say the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but there s no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election they ll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivals the long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their friends now in power will stage a comeback

ham,i can t believe i actually read a laugh out loud funny profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powell s extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbach s werblog entry rohit a trip to f c c world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell it s one of the first articles i ve seen that captures some of powell s real personality and the way he s viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isn t really a fire breathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know that s not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think he s right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasn t the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policy makers should learn from that experience contrary to lemann s speculation the upstart carriers won t be successful in a gore administration because it s too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than world dominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely that s why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but he s wrong in thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past friday october NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am comments NUMBER URL the chairman by nicholas lemann he s the other powell and no one is sure what he s up to new yorker october NUMBER NUMBER last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious american history course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selma to montgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteen forties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and in deed there was some of that but the main difference between my son s text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government s main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what you d find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them it s an insider s game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the press encouraged by the players who speak in jargon can t get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called f c c world for the federal communications commission f c c world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price NUMBER NUMBER a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairman s dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly self deprecating comedy routine by the commission s chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the f c c is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily life telephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now f c c world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the f c c qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of f c c world aol time warner is part of f c c world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of f c c world in the past two years companies belonging to f c c world have lost trillions of dollars in stock market valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the f c c has been circulating widely within f c c world it evokes f c c world s feverish mood the f c c is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of f c c world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all l d markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since NUMBER and suffering about NUMBER market share loss in business lines to clecs it s a lot easier to think about evil c e o s than to decipher that even in good times f c c world pays obsessive attention to the commission s chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f c c world devotes itself to full time chairman watching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by government official standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what he s really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the f c c s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the f c c s incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy he s always saying that he s an avid moderate and yet he has a rage inciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as he s accused of being a right wing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it ain t about singing kum ba yah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittee s chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you don t care about these regulations hollings said you don t care about the law or what congress sets down that s the fundamental that s the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pell mell down the road and seem to not care at all i think you d be a wonderful executive vice president of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one cannot understand powell s maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the f c c was created by congress in NUMBER but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as f c c world grew up into a comfortable well established place the f c c segued into the role of industrial supervision its real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the public s interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an oft told f c c world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the so and so who owned the anti clinton little rock democrat gazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president f c c world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteen eighties the successful breakup of a t t by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of self confidence onto the consciousness of f c c world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one long distance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the mid nineteen nineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national long distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines a t t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the f c c had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federal agency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of NUMBER one of those massive endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which most people outside f c c world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to f c c world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vice president gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base clinton s slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twenty first century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gore s cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success the f c c had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rule making enforcement and litigation the f c c then headed by reed hundt who was gore s classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only long distance companies like a t t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies see lecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand to hand combat the see leck is supposed to have access to the arbock s switching equipment the arbock won t give the seeleck a key to the room where it s kept so the see leck asks the f c c to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the see lecks companies with names like winstar covad and teligent and into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt s former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and a t t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self dealing stock overselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the NUMBER presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the f c c remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the c e o of s b c communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didn t want wood as head of the f c c because he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn t as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgott roth powell did this deftly for example in december of NUMBER he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speech whimsical intellectual and free associative biblical history joseph schumpeter moore s law that began by making fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the NUMBER act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in who ville who feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act s fertile soil but this feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the see lecks are dead or dying nearly all long distance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the long distance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the NUMBER telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radio station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty five per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the f c c should be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the government s money and muscle to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in f c c world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powell s f c c has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the f c c and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in mid september powell finally initiated a formal review of the f c c s limits on media concentration this doesn t mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of f c c world really make sense while giving the impression that he s having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital divide that is economic inequality in access to the internet he said you know i think there is a mercedes divide i d like to have one and i can t afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the f c c until NUMBER when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the city s open air fish market f c c world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the f c c building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairman s suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in NUMBER when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact prophylactically as he likes to say should wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protégé of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government s legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york public school system it testifies to powell s political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bush s nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school it s sort of like a law school study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom he d invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the f c c for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think we ll never know powell said i don t think it s an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we don t seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line there s a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company it s a similar proposition there are scholars who argue indeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that we re accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes he s like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the NUMBER telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i can t fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly i ve always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things it s going to open up i mean i don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dot com excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirty per cent market share fifty per cent market share i want the bells to bleed then we ll know we ve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while they re there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking there s no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like government promised opportunity the problem with that is there s a morning after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for short term gain we paid a price in long term stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldn t have every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway i don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service i don t buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldn t the part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadn t materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybody s always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the story s quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions don t get that good except once every thirty years and it didn t happen so whatever the reason we re looking at a worldcom that s teetering we re looking at a long distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base a t t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the f c c have done anything to make the long distance companies stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my political answer yes there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s e c investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i don t have those kinds of levers i don t know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gestures in august for example five months after disbanding the f c c s accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that there s one of each of those things but let s not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they aren t direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics it s easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybody s controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity i think that s a possibility i don t think it s nearly the possibility that s ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies like here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic the fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out f c c world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulates so he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that he s carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anything at the f c c that would diminish his chances another is that he s waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in f c c world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powell s idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isn t happy about what has become of his telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than say the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but there s no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election they ll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivals the long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their friends now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecognizably different from america s past

ham, wrong vms like async io makes a huge difference in even what i consider small programs so it sounds as if to your thinking most useful apps are also trivial unless each key on my keyboard were to the apps distinct event sources i can t think of any of my usual job mix that would need hundreds or even tens of async requests perhaps you can explain how nontrivial apps will be compellingly useful but it s still not built in who knows when it will be the point is it s not portable in either case does that lack of portability imply it isn t generally useful when it was apparent that tcp networks were useful berkeley sockets could be found even on vms and win NUMBER NUMBER boxen why would early unix have run with the idea that if one wishes to do multiple things at the same time one can use a group of processes to do them they had multics as a counterexample in the days of tiny memories and tapes people were more accustomed to writing programs that didn t run entirely in a single address space one is a great number for an interface as log NUMBER is NUMBER and specification can be implicit some combination of the above now as hoare says there are two ways of constructing a software design one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies as programmers we ve been able to make our lives complicated for at least half a century the hardware interrupt gives us the rope part of dijkstra s inspiration for the was the counterexample of ibm s multi programmed boxes were these the same ones that inspired mythical man month and i suppose he would say the question is how not to make a mess of it how should we structure computations so if we try to do ten times as many things at the same time reasoning about the resulting system is at most ten times more complex not one hundred and certainly not three and a half million times more compared to that project the prospect of writing a driver library for various vendors aio implementations seems to be truly trivial dave oracle in their quest for portability used to use raw disks for the database this finessed the filesystem issue did it also allow them to roll their own set of async drivers

and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than NUMBER a day is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new music and news channel for NUMBER NUMBER year old arabs it s NUMBER in practically every market it s entered nearing NUMBER listenership in amman and it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our NUMBER military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are

the bush doctrine for pre emptive strikes i d sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit september NUMBER NUMBER full text bush s national security strategy following is the full text of president bush s new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administration s policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and self defense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september NUMBER NUMBER taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other long standing alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of america s international strategy our nation s cause has always been larger than our nation s defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER the united states possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the u s national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not america s alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways america s constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern europe between NUMBER and NUMBER or in belgrade in NUMBER when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington d c the national cathedral september NUMBER NUMBER the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al qaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening america s homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may NUMBER NUMBER concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u s action direct or indirect is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israeli palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of america s close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israel s identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september NUMBER NUMBER and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees india s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows u s assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub saharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER the nature of the cold war threat required the united states with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous in the NUMBERs we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd armed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g NUMBER agreement to commit up to NUMBER billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september NUMBER NUMBER mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march NUMBER NUMBER a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america s shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u s national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners including through the group of seven g NUMBER to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g NUMBER action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november NUMBER will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in NUMBER the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russia s preparations to join the wto press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas targeted for completion in NUMBER this year the united states will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act and leading to free trade move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in NUMBER the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially central america southern africa morocco and australia will be our principal focal points renew the executive congressional partnership every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of NUMBER years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of NUMBER this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the NUMBER countries of sub saharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into u s trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce america s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by NUMBER percent over the next NUMBER years by the year NUMBER our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic u n framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for u s cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of NUMBER NUMBER billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a NUMBER million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington d c inter american development bank march NUMBER NUMBER a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than NUMBER a day is neither just nor stable including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of u s international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the u n conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change this administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a NUMBER percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor we have reversed the downward trend in u s contributions and proposed an NUMBER percent increase in the u s contributions to the international development association ida the world bank s fund for the poorest countries and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to u s leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the u s contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens as a result of u s leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hiv aids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hiv aids organized by u n secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about NUMBER percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least NUMBER percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the NUMBER million people including NUMBER million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the NUMBERth century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter european security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september NUMBER were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v self defense clause for the first time nato s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under nato s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions to achieve this we must expand nato s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september NUMBER energized america s asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september NUMBER was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that america s alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on NUMBER years of u s australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the euro atlantic community and the united states russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russia s entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the nato russia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia s growing commitment to integration into the euro atlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u s interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over NUMBER billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september NUMBER NUMBER fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september NUMBER NUMBER the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins

ham, URL hamza s horrid but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER the guardian sheikh abu hamza al masri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park hackney i ve often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by b q on the way home i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea an ice cream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you too but b q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza s budget since the bank of england froze his assets so victoria park had to do but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful islamic proto warriors in the background you must know hamza he s the imam designed it would seem by the daily mail s cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eye covered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milky white we don t mock the disabled any more these days unless it s someone like hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come off so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right as captain hook in articles which usually call for his arrest or extradition to the us or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities anywhere really just out of here and if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him to shut up because we don t like hamza very much we weren t that fond of him before september NUMBER but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political persecution and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out of context and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered but perhaps he should be because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror s scoop hamza preaches or preached at the scary finsbury park mosque so earlier this year the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks i didn t know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen he is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press and this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be true hamza is not representative of british muslims as if british muslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succour the trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those government approved muslim spokesmen who were uncomfortably i suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban an opinion poll commissioned by radio NUMBER s today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush s crusade one in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the us the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam which is what hamza said repeatedly but it was something that at the time we didn t want to hear now if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across superficially at least as someone from the liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth nor is he particularly anti semitic so far as i can tell although i don t suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterday s guardian the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy in a truly islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for example you and i would find many perhaps most of his views utterly repellent and that s the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism multiculturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from them the fbi has been investigating hamza but of course has found nothing remotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally this is a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash you don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist and if british muslims maybe a minority maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the man up therefore won t make a difference it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by

ham,the times december NUMBER NUMBER university boom creates era of sexual tolerance by helen rumbelow the boom in university education has led to a sea change in britain s tolerance of homosexuality according to a report just under half the people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong down from three quarters NUMBER years ago according to the british social attitudes survey regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion that trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities with NUMBER per cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced compared with NUMBER per cent in NUMBER geoffrey evans a politics professor at oxford university decided to focus on what has caused britain to become more open minded in a report published today the study from the national centre for social research is based on interviews with a cross section of NUMBER NUMBER people young people are much more tolerant than their elders with a quarter of twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong compared with two thirds of pensioners but the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college with graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no gcses and a third less racist that transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from and with NUMBER per cent of young people now attending university it was a powerful social effect professor evans said mr blair s famous mantra education education education seems far less consequential now than when first announced in NUMBER as britain struggles with an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people get degrees degrees buy less and less he said but the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance he added he decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would give to an unattractive minority white supremacists again people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections three times as many as those with no qualifications it is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant the report says adding that it may be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view professor evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism but found the opposite to be true thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties he said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older generation britain would become an ever more relaxed place soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability with more than half the country wanting cannabis to be legalised compared with a third seven years ago that is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it a third of labour voters twice as many as conservatives had tried the drug and being young living in london and having a degree also increased the chances one issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs most take a strong position on heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years now the proportion of people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept up to NUMBER per cent the views on heroin show that britain is by no means becoming a liberal free for all alison park co director of the study said people are making quite a clear distinction between what they think of as right and wrong on other matters the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits in fact they account for NUMBER per cent that union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past NUMBER years with just under a third of workers in a union and that half those questioned oppose secondary school selection in NUMBER the figure was NUMBER per cent the survey also indicates that NUMBER per cent of men aged between NUMBER and NUMBER live with their parents twice as many as women to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL

ham, URL the new yorker the next world order by nicholas lemann the bush administration may have a brand new doctrine of power issue of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER posted NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER when there is a change of command and not just in government the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected this feeling seems especially intense in the bush administration perhaps because bill clinton has been bracketed by a father son team it s easy for people in the administration to believe that after an unfortunate eight year interlude the bush family has resumed its governance and about time too the bush administration s sense that the clinton years were a waste or worse is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs republicans tend to regard democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy anyway in ways that coincide with what people think of as clinton s weak points an eagerness to please a lack of discipline condoleezza rice bush s national security adviser wrote an article in foreign affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused clinton of an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this administration also served under the president s father they took office last year after what they regard as eight years of small time flyswatting by clinton thinking that they were picking up where they d left off not long ago i had lunch with sorry a senior administration foreign policy official at a restaurant in washington called the oval room early in the lunch he handed me a twenty seven page report whose cover bore the seal of the department of defense an outline map of the world and these words defense strategy for the NUMBERs the regional defense strategy secretary of defense dick cheney january NUMBER one of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is communicating its drama actors professional athletes and even elected politicians train for years go through a great winnowing and then perform publicly people who have titles like deputy assistant secretary of defense are just as ambitious and competitive have worked just as long and hard and are often playing for even higher stakes but what they do all day is go to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings how possibly to explain that some of the documents including the report that the senior official handed me which was physically indistinguishable from a high school term paper represent the government version of playing carnegie hall after the fall of the berlin wall dick cheney then the secretary of defense set up a shop as they say to think about american foreign policy after the cold war at the grand strategic level the project whose existence was kept quiet included people who are now back in the game at a higher level among them paul wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense lewis libby cheney s chief of staff and eric edelman a senior foreign policy adviser to cheney generally speaking a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger thinking tougher minded and intellectually bolder than most other people in washington donald rumsfeld the secretary of defense shares these characteristics and has been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years colin powell then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mounted a competing and presumably more ideologically moderate effort to reimagine american foreign policy and defense a date was set may NUMBER NUMBER on which each team would brief cheney for an hour cheney would then brief president bush after which bush would make a foreign policy address unveiling the new grand strategy everybody worked for months on the five twenty one brief with a sense that the shape of the post cold war world was at stake when wolfowitz and powell arrived at cheney s office on may NUMBERst wolfowitz went first but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour and cheney a hawk who perhaps liked what he was hearing did not call time on him powell didn t get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in the world until a couple of weeks later cheney briefed president bush using material mostly from wolfowitz and bush prepared his major foreign policy address but he delivered it on august NUMBER NUMBER the day that iraq invaded kuwait so nobody noticed the team kept working in NUMBER the times got its hands on a version of the material and published a front page story saying that the pentagon envisioned a future in which the united states could and should prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power a few weeks of controversy ensued about the bush administration s hawks being unilateral controversy that cheney s people put an end to with denials and the counter leak of an edited softer version of the same material as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton the cheney team s efforts took on the quality of a parting shot the report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before clinton took office it is a somewhat bland opaque document a scrubbed meaning unclassified version of something more candid but it contained the essential ideas of shaping rather than reacting to the rest of the world and of preventing the rise of other superpowers its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships a more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled from containment to global leadership which zalmay khalilzad who joined cheney s team in NUMBER and is now special envoy to afghanistan published a couple of years into the clinton administration when he was out of government it recommends that the united states preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future khalilzad writes it is a vital u s interest to preclude such a development i e to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose when george w bush was campaigning for president he and the people around him didn t seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift along the lines of the policy of containment of the soviet union s sphere of influence which the united states maintained during the cold war in his first major foreign policy speech delivered in november of NUMBER bush declared that a president must be a clear eyed realist a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world remaking ambition realism is exactly the foreign policy doctrine that cheney s pentagon team rejected partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country s ever dominating world affairs for any length of time one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of september NUMBERth have changed official foreign policy thinking any chief executive of either party would probably have done what bush has done so far made war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic security it is only now six months after the attacks that we are truly entering the realm of presidential choice and all indications are that bush is going to use september NUMBERth as the occasion to launch a new aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism all his rhetoric especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress since september NUMBERth and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked indicate that he sees this as the nation s moment of destiny a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging because it enhances bush s stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking inside government the reason september NUMBERth appears to have been a transformative moment as the senior official i had lunch with put it is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american public s usual resistance to american military involvement overseas at least for a while the clinton administration beginning with the black hawk down operation in mogadishu during its first year operated on the conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties the all bombing kosovo operation in clinton s next to last year was the ideal foreign military adventure now that the united states has been attacked the options are much broader the senior official approvingly mentioned a NUMBER study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies which argued that the mass public is much less casualty averse than the military or the civilian élite believes for example the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction the american death total in the vietnam war was about fifty eight thousand september NUMBERth presumably reduced casualty aversion even further recently i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice rice s foreign affairs article from NUMBER begins with this declaration the united states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its national interest in the absence of soviet power i asked her whether that is still the case i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role she said immediately i think september NUMBERth was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen events are in much sharper relief like bush she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible states now define the national interest the latter goal by the way is new in bush s speech to congress on september NUMBERth america s sole grand purpose was ending terrorism we talked in her west wing office its tall windows face the part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their standups in her bearing rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public she looked a little tired but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm rather than belligerence in the foreign affairs article rice came across as a classic realist putting forth the notions of power politics great powers and power balances as the proper central concerns of the united states now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one power idea that cheney s pentagon team proposed ten years ago or at least to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the united states because of the terrorist attacks and can be induced to remain so theoretically the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it rice said and i think what you re seeing is that there s at least a predilection this time to move to productive and coöperative relations with the united states rather than to try to balance the united states i actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out it s not all foreordained rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the national security council and asked them to think seriously about how do you capitalize on these opportunities to fundamentally change american doctrine and the shape of the world in the wake of september NUMBERth i really think this period is analogous to NUMBER to NUMBER she said that is the period when the containment doctrine took shape in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat and that it s a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition that has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics and it s important to try to seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again the national security council is legally required to produce an annual document called the national security strategy stating the over all goals of american policy another government report whose importance is great but not obvious the bush administration did not produce one last year as the clinton administration did not in its first year rice said that she is working on the report now there are two ways to handle this document she told me one is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out but it s our view that since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration it s important an awful lot has happened since we started this process prior to NUMBER NUMBER i can t give you a certain date when it s going to be out but i would think sometime this spring and it s important that it be a real statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction that it s going it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago some questions that don t appear to be settled yet but are obviously being asked are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries and to what end and with what means the leak a couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture adding offensive capability against rogue states departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on is the united states now in a position to be redrawing regional maps especially in the middle east and replacing governments by force nobody thought that the bush administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms but plainly it is and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago just before the NUMBER election a republican foreign policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a bush administration s direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher ranking job paul wolfowitz or richard haass haass is another veteran of the first bush administration and an intellectual like wolfowitz but much more moderate in NUMBER he published a book titled the reluctant sheriff in which he poked a little fun at wolfowitz s famous strategy briefing of the early nineties he called it the pentagon paper and disagreed with its idea that the united states should try to be the world s only great power over the long term for better or worse such a goal is beyond our reach haass wrote it simply is not doable elsewhere in the book he disagreed with another of the wolfowitz team s main ideas that of the united states expanding the democratic zone of peace primacy is not to be confused with hegemony the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic haass argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world not more and suggested a revival of what might be called traditional great power politics wolfowitz got a higher ranking job than haass he is deputy secretary of defense and haass is director of policy planning for the state department in effect colin powell s big think guy recently i went to see him in his office at the state department on the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy planning staff beginning with george kennan the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that haass now occupies it s another indication of the way things are moving in washington that haass seems to have become more hawkish i mentioned the title of his book using the word reluctant was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make he said it was written when bill clinton was saying it s the economy stupid not it s the world stupid two things are very different now one the president has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters second at the top of the national security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as kennan s containment i think there is he said what you re seeing from this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas i m not sure it constitutes a doctrine about what you might call the limits of sovereignty sovereignty entails obligations one is not to massacre your own people another is not to support terrorism in any way if a government fails to meet these obligations then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty including the right to be left alone inside your own territory other governments including the united states gain the right to intervene in the case of terrorism this can even lead to a right of preventive or peremptory self defense you essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it s a question of when and not if you re going to be attacked clearly haass was thinking of iraq i don t think the american public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein he said also i d fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the case public opinion can be changed we d be able to make the case that this isn t a discretionary action but one done in self defense on the larger issue of the american role in the world haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks he had made a speech not long before called imperial america but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist i just think that we have to be a little bit careful he said great as our advantages are there are still limits we have to have allies we can t impose our ideas on everyone we don t want to be fighting wars alone so we need others to join us american leadership yes but not american unilateralism it has to be multilateral we can t win the war against terror alone we can t send forces everywhere it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor he stopped for a moment is there a successor idea to containment i think there is he said it is the idea of integration the goal of u s foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction support for free trade democracy markets integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more the first but by no means the last obvious manifestation of a new american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein what the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf what s been done so far in afghanistan both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath several weeks ago ahmad chalabi the head of the iraqi national congress the iraqi opposition party came through washington with an entourage of his aides chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask evidently successfully for more american funding his main public event was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute chalabi s leading supporter in town richard perle the prominent hawk and former defense department official acted as moderator smiling and supremely confident perle opened the discussion by saying evidence is mounting that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with saddam hussein the war on terrorism he said will not be complete until saddam is successfully dealt with and that means replacing his regime that action will be taken i have no doubt chalabi who lives in london is a charming suave middle aged man with a twinkle in his eye he was dressed in a double breasted pin striped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar although he and his supporters argue that the iraqi national congress with sufficient american support can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the taliban in afghanistan this view hasn t won over most people in washington it isn t just that chalabi doesn t look the part of a rebel military leader he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the savoy but that s about it one skeptical former pentagon official told me or that he isn t in iraq it s also that saddam s military is perhaps ten times the size that the taliban s was and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade the united states left iraq in NUMBER believing that saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion chalabi s supporters believe that saddam is much weaker now and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off but non true believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground troops kenneth pollack a former c i a analyst who was the national security council s staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton administration recently caused a stir in the foreign policy world by publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two co authors published an article also in foreign affairs arguing that the iraqi national congress was incapable of defeating saddam pollack still doesn t think chalabi can do the job he believes that it would require a substantial american ground air and sea force closer in size to the one we used in kuwait in NUMBER NUMBER than to the one we are using now in afghanistan pollack who is trim quick and crisp is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day when i went to see him at his office in washington with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall where three maps of the middle east were hanging the only way to do it is a full scale invasion he said using a pen as a pointer we re talking about two grand corps two to three hundred thousand people altogether the population is here in the tigris euphrates valley he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra ideally you d have the saudis on board he pointed to the prince sultan airbase near riyadh you could make kuwait the base but it s much easier in saudi you need to take western iraq and southern iraq pointing again because otherwise they ll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil fields you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil fields so troops have to occupy them and you need troops to defend the kurds in northern iraq point point you go in as hard as you can as fast as you can he slapped his hand on the top of his desk you get the enemy to divide his forces by threatening him in two places at once his hand hit the desk again hard then you crush him smack that would be a reverberating blow the united states has already removed the government of one country afghanistan the new government is obviously shaky and american military operations there are not completed pakistan which before september NUMBERth clearly met the new test of national unacceptability it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction will also require long term attention since the country is not wholly under the control of the government as the murder of daniel pearl demonstrated and even parts of the government like the intelligence service may not be entirely under the control of the president in iraq if america invades and brings down saddam a new government must be established an enormous long term task in a country where there is no obvious plausible new leader the prospective iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations one of which russia is a nuclear superpower an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations iran turkey saudi arabia and even egypt events have forced the administration to become directly involved in the israeli palestinian conflict as it hadn t wanted to do so it s really the entire region that is in play in much the way that europe was immediately after the second world war in september bush rejected paul wolfowitz s recommendation of immediate moves against iraq that the president seems to have changed his mind is an indication in part of the bureaucratic skill of the administration s conservatives these guys are relentless one former official who is close to the high command at the state department told me resistance is futile the conservatives other weapon besides relentlessness is intellectualism colin powell tends to think case by case and since september NUMBERth the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading iraq if the united states applies the doctrines of cheney s old pentagon team shaping and expanding the zone of democracy the implications would extend far beyond that one operation the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with the administration seem to be bernard lewis of princeton and fouad ajami of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies both of whom see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation lewis was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior foreign policy staff one point he made is look in that part of the world nothing matters more than resolute will and force the senior official i had lunch with told me in other words the united states needn t proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the arab street as long as it is prepared to be strong the senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the middle east charles hill of yale who in a recent essay declared every regime of the arab islamic world has proved a failure and reuel marc gerecht of the american enterprise institute who published an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in iran and syria those goals gerecht told me when we spoke could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion several people i spoke with predicted that most or even all of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to finish the job one purpose of vice president cheney s recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation in any event the administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world s approval when i spoke to condoleezza rice she said that the united states should assemble coalitions of the willing to support its actions rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations an invasion of iraq would test that policy in more ways than one the administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the iraq operation when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year it asked for a forty eight billion dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal NUMBER which begins in october NUMBER much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism that s probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of iraq this spring the administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion trying to secure basing and overflight privileges while bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction a drama involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer and will end with the united states declaring that the terms that saddam offers for the inspections involving delays and restrictions are unacceptable then probably in the late summer or early fall the enormous troop positioning which will take months will begin the administration obviously feels confident that the united states can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop buildup and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the republican guard the military key to the country to turn against saddam and topple him on its own but the chain of events leading inexorably to a full scale american invasion if it hasn t already begun evidently will begin soon lewis scooter libby who was the principal drafter of cheney s future of the world documents during the first bush administration now works in an office in the old executive office building overlooking the west wing where he has a second smaller office a packet of public relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his NUMBER novel the apprentice quotes the times calling him dick cheney s dick cheney which seems like an apt description he appears absolutely sure of himself and whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss speaks in a tough confidential gravelly rumble like condoleezza rice and bush himself he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right the only truly prudent course when i went to see libby not long ago i asked him whether before september NUMBERth american policy toward terrorism should have been different he went to his desk and got out a large black loose leaf binder filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle east he looked through it for a long minute formulating his answer let us stack it up he said at last somalia NUMBER NUMBER the discovery of the al qaeda related plot in the philippines NUMBER the world trade center first bombing NUMBER the attempt to assassinate president bush former president bush and the lack of response to that the lack of a serious response to that NUMBER the riyadh bombing NUMBER the khobar bombing NUMBER the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy bombing NUMBER the plot to launch millennium attacks NUMBER the bombing of the cole throughout this period infractions on inspections by the iraqis and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime and the failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas no one would say these challenges posed easy problems but if you take that long list and you ask did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities or activities clearly against our interests did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against u s interests many observers conclude no and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise up and say credibly the americans don t have the stomach to defend themselves they won t take casualties to defend their interests they are morally weak libby insisted that the american response to september NUMBERth has not been standard or foreordained look at what the president has done in afghanistan he said and look at his speech to the joint session of congress meaning the state of the union message in january he made it clear that it s an important area he made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests and he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part take the afghan case for example there are many other courses that the president could have taken he could have waited for juridical proof before we responded he could have engaged in long negotiations with the taliban he could have failed to seek a new relationship with pakistan based on its past nuclear tests or been so afraid of weakening pakistan that we didn t seek its help this list could go on to twice or three times the length i ve mentioned so far but instead the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests the problem is complex and we don t know yet how it will end but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with afghanistan as important as it was as a threat but with the states of central asia pakistan russia and as it may develop with the states of southwest asia more generally we moved on to iraq and the question of what makes saddam hussein unacceptable in the administration s eyes the issue is not inspections libby said the issue is the iraqis promise not to have weapons of mass destruction their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait their promise not to threaten other countries and other promises that they made in NUMBER and a number of u n resolutions including all the other problems i listed whether it was wise or not and that is the subject of debate iraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms it failed to take that chance then and annually for the next ten years what s your level of confidence i asked him that the current regime will in fact change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately there is no basis in iraq s past behavior to have confidence in good faith efforts on their part to change their behavior r a hettinga

ham,hi kragen this is an interesting analysis i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick for example i don t expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while i think that the most important issue which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems is almost passed over i know that you know this and you allude to it but your essay is getting passed around so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others there s one other point which you don t make which i think is very important which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you can define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we wouldn t have stackguard itsNUMBER nissus or snort and the security admin s job

forwarded message date thu NUMBER aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER edt from kragen sitaker kragen pobox com to fork URL subject the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards on august NUMBERth an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late NUMBERs which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulnerability in hp s truNUMBER unix secret if hp retained snosoft s consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret i ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i don t think that s plausible if someone can steal NUMBER NUMBER because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software aren t liable either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote root hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime let s not let that happen this is the original idefense announcement from sunil james mailto sjames URL sent wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject introducing idefense s vulnerability contributor program greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the work the compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared i e vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i

family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and

list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that

ham, begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER say amen somebody what the wsj said appended below the wtc as constructed was a confiscatory government boondoggle expropriated from the original pre construction property owners at the behest of a third generation trust fund aristocrat for the good of the city and owned by an authority looking for something else to do after it and its coach hounds in organized labor and organized crime had killed what was the largest port in the world s richest nation now of course it s about to get worse the sins of NUMBER years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics first those in religion and now those in government as a result a large part of NUMBER million square feet of once perfectly usable office space devoted at least ostensibly to commerce will be granted away in a potlatch that only government and special interest communities or stakeholders or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho rabble call themselves this week can organize to such perfection all this in probably the only city in the country that was founded by a business explicitly for the purpose of commerce not religious fanaticism not colonial expansion in a monarch s name commerce if they really wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government disarmed passengers the so called authority should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the market the cure to all luddism foreign and domestic government and superstitious decide if the new private owner wants to sell or give away a space for a memorial fine they could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured probably great for marketing the property at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event and of course if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall or with twice as much space than the original NUMBER million square feet splendid whatever the market will bear in these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans national geodesic internetworks of strong financial cryptography and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries economics and freedom can and will prevail over both superstition and statism it s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower manhattan mega real estate to prevail this early in the game but it s going to happen sooner or later and whenever it does that will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the world trade center cheers rah URL the wall street journal september NUMBER NUMBER review outlook a living memorial as we write these words we can look down from our offices into the six story crater where the twin towers once stood like everyone else we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions especially today anger grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working meeting shopping eating that is engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan which lost NUMBER NUMBER jobs when the trade center fell instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action new york s political leadership and its financial and media elites are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better more prosperous city this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site in consultation with new york governor george pataki who is thinking primarily about his own november re election the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial the manhattan institute s steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial a design for which has yet to be decided a big part of the problem in new york is that the city s anti development activists know an opening when they see one they want the world trade center site and even some surrounding areas transformed into an enormous park these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment worse they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti development agenda in the name of honoring the dead one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site we are not experts in designing war memorials but we re confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world s financial center isn t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago the great cities of europe and japan devastated in world war ii have all rebuilt and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be in this country the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university you ll find the names of NUMBER alumni who died in the revolutionary war the war of NUMBER the civil war the spanish american war world war i world war ii korea and southeast asia no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names in new york now it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city s future rudolph giuliani now that he s out office wants the entire NUMBER acres devoted to the memorial governor pataki has called for no structures on the footprints which being in the center of the site would severely curtail options mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past maybe those responsible for the world trade center
